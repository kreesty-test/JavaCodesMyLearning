 How to model problem in OOPS:

 - Noun --> class -> employee
 - adjective --> attributes -> name, age, salary
 - verb --> methods --> getSalary() , increment()

 OOPS terminology:
 1.Abstraction -> Hiding internal details (show only essential information)
 2.Encapsulation -> The act of putting various components together(in a capsule)
 ** Note : In java it simply means hiding sensitive data from users
 3. Inheritance -> The act of deriving new things from existing things
